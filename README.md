Trading-Bot
==============================

My private pet Project for Trading bot and stock/crypto analysis  

---------------- For potential employers ----------------------
#### What was done 
1. Exploration Analysis of stocks and their indicators you will find in folder "notebooks"
2. Data retrieved from AlphaVantage provider via API
3. A few techniques for next-day forecasting using basic features were done and outlined for comparison here: https://github.com/Folongton/p7-trading-bot/blob/main/models_table.csv
4. By getting thru the literature and experimenting myself I came to the conclusion of using the LSTM network. The Basic Network is ready.
5. Framework is ready for testing of new features. For feature selection Planing to use PCA ( Principal component Analysis), RF (Random Forest), and Autoencoder. With possible experimentation with Ensemble of technics.
